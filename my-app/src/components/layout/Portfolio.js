                    <p> Programming is my vocation of choice for the foreseeable future; however, <em><strong>music</strong></em> is my true passion.  I've played guitar for over 10 years and strive to continuously push my limits.  In addition, I have studied Audio Engineering and enjoy mixing & creating tracks in my spare time.  A typical routine involves drilling finger dexterity, arpeggios, and learning new chord voicings.  Once I am warmed-up, I practice "freestyling" over jam-tracks that other musicians have shared over the internet.  The last hour of practice consists of repertoire learning, of which I generally seek more challenging pieces. </p>

      <p>I grew up in a small Californian suburban town called Cordelia.  Growing up I've always yearned for more - I wondered about what the rest of the world was like and what people might be like.  That curiosity remains to this day - I seek to broaden my worldview and to experience as many firsts as I possibly can within this lifetime.  Over the years I have visited mostly neighboring states including: Oregon, Nevada, & Arizona.  My sights are now set on the rest of the United States and countries such as Japan, Canada, Italy, Greece, England, Germany, Switzerland, etc.   </p>

        <p>I've always wondered what it would be like to be consistently in peak physical condition for the self.  I have taken it upon myself to train daily with the intent of competing for the Boston Marathon. </p>
